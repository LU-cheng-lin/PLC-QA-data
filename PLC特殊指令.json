    },
    {
        "question": "Can M8017 adjust by one minute instead of 30s?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8017\n```\n\nExplanation: No; use RTC write instructions for larger adjustments."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can RTC read and M8017 correction occur simultaneously?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8016\nAND M8017\n```\n\nExplanation: Not recommended; pause display (M8016=ON) before correction (M8017)."

    {
        "question": "When does M8018 turn ON?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8018\nOUT Y0\n```\n\nExplanation: ON when the RTC module or card is detected as inserted."
    },
    {
        "question": "If no RTC card is inserted, what is M8018?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8018\n```\n\nExplanation: M8018=OFF, indicating no RTC module or connection error."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to protect RTC operations using M8018?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8018\nAND X0\nOUT M10\n```\n\nExplanation: Only when RTC module is present (M8018=ON) and X0=ON does RTC read/write occur."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can M8018 signal card removal?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLDN M8018\nOUT Y5\n```\n\nExplanation: M8018=OFF triggers Y5 warning for card absence."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does M8018 update immediately on card change?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8018\n```\n\nExplanation: Yes; hardware detection updates M8018 on insertion/removal."
    },
    {
        "question": "When does M8019 turn ON?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8019\nOUT Y0\n```\n\nExplanation: ON when the RTC experiences errors or read/write failures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the relationship between M8019 and M8018?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8018\nLD M8019\n```\n\nExplanation: M8018 indicates module presence; M8019 indicates RTC errors. They operate independently."
    },
    {
        "question": "What actions on RTC error?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8019\nOUT Y10  // Warning lamp\nMOV K0 D500  // Reset time registers\n```\n\nExplanation: Alert operator and attempt reinitialization."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does M8019 reset OFF automatically?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8019\n```\n\nExplanation: Resets OFF after error is cleared and RTC reinitialized."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to prevent frequent RTC errors?",
        "answer": "Example code:\n```\nLD M8019\n```\n\nExplanation: Ensure stable battery voltage, proper module connection, and correct RTC handling."
